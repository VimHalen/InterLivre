FFmpeg LICENSE INFO
<https://www.ffmpeg.org/legal.html>
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.html>
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html>

FFmpeg is licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL) version 2.1 or later. However, FFmpeg incorporates
several optional parts and optimizations that are covered by the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2 or later. If
those parts get used the GPL applies to all of FFmpeg.

Read the license texts to learn how this affects programs built on top of FFmpeg or reusing FFmpeg. You may also wish to
have a look at the GPL FAQ.

Note that FFmpeg is not available under any other licensing terms, especially not proprietary/commercial ones, not even
in exchange for payment.

LAME LICENSE INFO
<https://lame.sourceforge.io/license.txt>

Can I use LAME in my commercial program?  

Yes, you can, under the restrictions of the LGPL (see COPYING
in this folder). The easiest way to do this is to:

1. Link to LAME as separate library (libmp3lame.a on unix or 
   lame_enc.dll or libmp3lame.dll on windows)

2. Fully acknowledge that you are using LAME, and give a link
   to our web site, www.mp3dev.org

3. If you make modifications to LAME, you *must* release these
   modifications back to the LAME project, under the LGPL.

*** IMPORTANT NOTE ***

The decoding functions provided in LAME use a version of the mpglib decoding
engine which is under the GPL.  They may not be used by any program not
released under the GPL unless you obtain such permission from the MPG123
project (www.mpg123.de).
(yes, we know MPG123 is currently under the LGPL, but we use an older version
that was released under the former license and, until someone tweaks the
current MPG123 to suit some of LAME's specific needs, it'll continue being
licensed under the GPL)

wxPython LICENSE INFO
<https://wxpython.org/pages/license/index.html>

License
OSI Approved License
wxPython is licenced under the "wxWindows Library Licence".

The wxWindows Library Licence is essentially the L-GPL (Library General Public Licence), with an exception stating that
derived works in binary form may be distributed on the user's own terms. This is a solution that satisfies those who
wish to produce GPL'ed software using wxWidgets, and also those producing proprietary software.

The wxWindows Library Licence has been approved by the Open Source Initiative.

In August 2005, an ambiguity in Clause 2 was removed (replaced "the user's" with "your") and the version bumped to 3.1.

The following sections present the actual text of the various license files. In general you may replace "wxWidgets" with
"wxPython" in order to apply the license terms to your use of wxPython.

Preamble
The licencing of the wxWidgets library is intended to protect the wxWidgets
library, its developers, and its users, so that the considerable investment it
represents is not abused.

Under the terms of the original wxWidgets licences, you as a user are not
obliged to distribute wxWidgets source code with your products, if you
distribute these products in binary form. However, you are prevented from
restricting use of the library in source code form, or denying others the
rights to use or distribute wxWidgets library source code in the way intended.

The wxWindows Library License establishes the copyright for the code and
related material, and it gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or
modify the library. It also asserts that no warranty is given by the authors
for this or derived code.

The core distribution of the wxWidgets library contains files under two
different licences:

* Most files are distributed under the GNU Library General Public License,
  version 2, with the special exception that you may create and distribute
  object code versions built from the source code or modified versions of it
  (even if these modified versions include code under a different licence),
  and distribute such binaries under your own terms.

* Most core wxWidgets manuals are made available under the "wxWindows Free
  Documentation License", which allows you to distribute modified versions of
  the manuals, such as versions documenting any modifications made by you in
  your version of the library. However, you may not restrict any third party
  from reincorporating your changes into the original manuals.

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the terms of the GNU Library General Public Licence as published by
the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the Licence, or (at your
option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT

EXCEPTION NOTICE

1. As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give
permission for additional uses of the text contained in this release of the
library as licenced under the wxWindows Library Licence, applying either
version 3.1 of the Licence, or (at your option) any later version of the
Licence as published by the copyright holders of version 3.1 of the Licence
document.

2. The exception is that you may use, copy, link, modify and distribute
under your own terms, binary object code versions of works based on the
Library.

3. If you copy code from files distributed under the terms of the GNU
General Public Licence or the GNU Library General Public Licence into a
copy of this library, as this licence permits, the exception does not apply
to the code that you add in this way.  To avoid misleading anyone as to the
status of such modified files, you must delete this exception notice from
such code and/or adjust the licensing conditions notice accordingly.

4. If you write modifications of your own for this library, it is your
choice whether to permit this exception to apply to your modifications.  If
you do not wish that, you must delete the exception notice from such code
and/or adjust the licensing conditions notice accordingly.
